Take a look at the engine master branch project if you want to know what's on my mind right now and what I'm planning to do in the future.

**Things this engine has:**
* An application class that can be expanded to create your own game-loop-based thingies.
* A rendering interface that can be expanded with multiple different backends (the Vulkan one is my priority).
* An incline towards data-oriented design. This includes an ECS used for rendering, input management and a bunch of other stuff... potentially.
* Compute-ish capabilities
* My tears, blood AND sweat.
* A really crude windowing system.
* An attempt at PBR

**Things this engine does not have:**
* The ability to stay one week without heavy refactoring.

*Note: I am using this repo as a way to learn rendering algorithms and game engine architecture. This is not meant to be used in any professional capacity.*
